## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

This project for Udacity frontend course , I used the default (HTML , CSS )template provided by udacity and worked on the javascript file to make this landing page interactive

I've added :
1\ \_ Dynamic Navbar list with js .
2_Applied "active" class to the sections that just appears at the viewport .
3_Scrolling to the speacific section when click on the anchor tag and make it smooth scroll.
